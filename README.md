The spam SMS classifier ML model is designed to automatically classify text messages as either spam or not spam (ham). It is typically built using machine learning algorithm Naive Bayes.

The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages, where each message is labeled as ham or spam(0 0r 1). During training, the model learns patterns and features from the text messages that help it distinguish between spam and ham.

Once trained, the model can be used to predict whether a new SMS message is spam or ham based on its content. This prediction can be used to filter out spam messages and ensure that only relevant messages are delivered to users' inboxes.
